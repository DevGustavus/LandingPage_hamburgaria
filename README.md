## ðŸ“– About the project
In this project, I created a website for a fast-food business. I designed a simple and straightforward layout that is both intuitive and visually appealing. 
By applying UI/UX principles, I ensured that the website's structure is responsive across various screen sizes and devices. 
Additionally, when the media query is activated, the "hamburger menu" type is displayed.
